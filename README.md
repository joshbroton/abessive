#Abessive v1.1
a•bes•sive : indicating absence or lack

A new theme boilerplate unique for what it lacks.

#####A blending of the [HTML5 Boilerplate v5.0.0](https://html5boilerplate.com/) and the [Lemonly Project Boilerplate v1.0.0](https://github.com/Lemonly/project-boilerplate)

###Assumptions I've Made:
* You want a WordPress theme
* Sass for CSS preprocessing
* Loose BEM CSS syntax
* Gulp for tasks
* Posts and pages
* Two menus (header and footer)

###Based on these projects:
* [HTML5 Boilerplate v5.0.0](https://html5boilerplate.com/)
* [Lemonly Project Boilerplate v1.0.0](https://github.com/Lemonly/project-boilerplate)
* [Sassquatch](https://github.com/joshbroton/sassquatch)
* Lemonly HTML/CSS/JS style guides
