#Abessive
a•bes•sive : indicating absence or lack

A new theme boilerplate unique for what it lacks.

#####A blending of the HTML5 Boilerplate v5.0.0 and the Lemonly Project Boilerplate v0.2.1

###Assumptions I've Made:
* You want a WordPress theme
* Sass for CSS preprocessing
* Loose BEM CSS syntax
* Grunt for tasks
* Posts and pages
* Two menus (header and footer)

###Based on these projects:
* [HTML5 Boilerplate v5.0.0](https://html5boilerplate.com/)
* Lemonly Project Boilerplate v0.3
* Lemonly HTML/CSS/JS style guides
